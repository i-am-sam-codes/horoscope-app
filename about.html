            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h3>Hi, I am Sam! A bilingual, 2nd generation Latina native to the San Francisco Bay Area.<br> I have always been one chasing the creativity in this world. Growing up, I would love<br> to create and help others. 
                My internet life started when I was just 9years old and<br> I got to pick out my first computer at the Gateway store. I remember it vividly as it<br> came in a huge cow print box!<br>Fast forward a few years when Myspace popped up, my 12 year old self started spending<br> time trying towork with the layout codes so I could come up with cool looking porfolios.<br> Thats where the interest for design first began. The first time I interacted with code,<br> to create simple layouts and learning to understand the code behind designs.<br>I had no idea that later on in my 20â€™s I would come back to something similar and fall<br> in love. I decided to take the self-taught route and learn how to code in 2020 in the midst<br> of our Global Pandemic and quarintine life. COVID caused me to be laid off. This is where I<br> started to believe I wanted so much more than what I was currently doing.<br>Today, I am a self-taught Web Designer & Developer. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br> With a drive to help people and seeking opportunities for growth and creation!
